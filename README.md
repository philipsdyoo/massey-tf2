Using Numerical Methods to Rank eSports Teams

#Abstract
With the rise of eSports, the competitive form of videogames, what is the best way to rank these teams in the most objective way using numerical methods? This paper focuses on the use of a linear least-squares method called the Massey method to produce rankings based on matches won and point differences and explores how the Massey method behaves with changes to the data with numerical experimentation. The goal is to ultimately produce the best objective rankings for the Team Fortress 2 Invite teams from Season 20. The match data needed to be altered in order to achieve the most accurate rankings. Weights were also applied in order to obtain even more information on how to rank the teams. Also, the Massey matrix is well-conditioned after the so-called "cheat" step while it is ill-conditioned before it. The best ranking calculated by the weighted Massey Method from first to last is froyotech, Ascent, Team SoloUber, Strawberry Mangoes, woodpig, Getawhale Fanclub, Meat Market, MAD LUXURIOUS, and Kawaii Five-0.
